Items to complete program UPDATED:

- Create additional modals to specify how many of each character the user would like in their password. 
    - based upon this, a function will then need to be created to add the amount of characters (e.g., capital letter(s), lowercase letters(s), num, special) and compile into one password alltogether with the given limitations of 8-120 total characters
